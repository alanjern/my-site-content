I'm a cognitive scientist and psychologist. I use computational models and behavioral experiments to study how people think and reason. I'm primarily interested in social cognition: how people think about other people. I have also studied how people learn and use concepts, and how people revise their beliefs after seeing new evidence.

I write about TV and psychology at [Overthinking TV](http://overthinkingtv.com/).
